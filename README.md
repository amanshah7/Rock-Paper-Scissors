# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game was created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic. 
The interface allows users to select rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects a choice. 
JavaScript compares both selections and displays the result, updating the score accordingly.

The main challenge was ensuring the game logic worked correctly and that user interactions were responsive. 
This project helped reinforce DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic, while also improving understanding of how to create interactive web applications.
